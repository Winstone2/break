# break
In JavaScript, the break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It is typically used within loops (such as for, while, or do...while) and switch statements to terminate the current iteration or case and move on to the next part of the program.
In this example, we have a switch statement that checks the value of dayOfWeek and assigns the corresponding dayName. The break statement is used to exit each case block and prevent the code from falling through to the next case. It ensures that only the relevant block of code is executed based on the matched case.

The default case is used to handle situations where none of the cases match the value of dayOfWeek. If none of the cases match, the default block is executed, and the loop is terminated with a break statement. This helps prevent unnecessary execution of subsequent cases once a match is found.
The break statement plays a crucial role in controlling the flow of code within loops and switch statements, ensuring that the program behaves as expected and preventing unintended fall-through scenarios.
